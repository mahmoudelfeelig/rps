## Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for routes and URL paths.
- Use `camelCase` for functions, variables, and helper files.
- Keep feature-specific code close to the feature that uses it.
- Put static files under `public/assets/<purpose>/`, not at the root of `public/`.

## Runtime Notes

- `backend/index.js` serves the frontend public assets when the app is hosted together.
- `backend/public/assets/avatars/default-avatar.png` is the shared avatar fallback.
- `backend/routes/games.js` contains the RPS, spinner, casino, puzzle, and click-frenzy routes.
