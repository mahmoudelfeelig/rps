hard:-
- make the store items have actual effects
- 
easy:-
- make a max bet button for all games
- change the stakes of slots as it currently has a positive multiplier
- a counter for how much money you lost
- make all games unlocked

progression games:-
- rps (between two players)
- games not related to gambling 
- mystery boxes (to avoid hoarding cash)
- ngu which generates money idly at the same time for everyone but you can buy upgrade tickets to increase that rate
- gacha for cosmetic items (very low risk very high reward)


bugs:-
- pics get deleted as they're uploaded to render so that the next deployment they're not there anymore
- service card doesn't show edit/delete and wont allow 

features:-
- gifs as pfps (with money hehehe)
- change welcome to risk paper scammers to a new era of gambling with some animation to it
- let users sumbit a form for their desired bets and odds
- add stocks for rps members
- make it so that in click frenzy you can get a limited amount of money per day but you can continue clicking
  and it adds a counter and at the start of the year we reveal who did it the most
- change the dashboard to show the current bet OPTIONS as well
